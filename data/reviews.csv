Opinion;Rating
Rand is a great, reluctant hero. He is relatable and real. Jordan is part of a handful of fantasy authors who have changed the genre for all those who follow, contributing to the realm of what I call realistic fantasy. The mythic is not as prevalent as the real, which takes the story and draws it in tighter, gripping the reader even tighter. There are still clear comparisons with Tolkien, a female Gandalf-like character, etc., but allows the reader to see inside what Tolkien shrouded in legend. Highly recommended!;positive
Better the 2nd time around This was a reread for me, and it does not disappoint! I pick up so many things the second time, providing more understanding and enjoyment. Truly epic fantasy, yet relatable in the characters and their actions. Ideals and legends that are at once foreign and familiar. Looking forward to rereading the rest of the series.;positive
Great book. On to the next...;positive
Didn't read it but just from the description i'm seeing some lines from Tolkiens works which is really sad;positive
Hooked by page 20!;negative
I love this way of being another world. He EXPLAINS more than some authors do. There is never any dull moments of reading page on page of someone just THINKING! Love this and will continue to read the series!;positive
Good read. Moving on the next book.;positive
Memories Thank you  Thank you;positive
A fantastic intro to a truly amazing series and world, as well as an excellent and engaging story in its own right.;positive
This is probably the best first novel in an epic series of this magnitude. Beautiful.;positive
Good easy read.;positive
Aside from Tolkien's writings this is the best series I have ever read.;positive
An excellent openning novel to the wheel of time series;positive
I first heard of this series after getting hooked on Brandon Sanderson's books. After reading, literally, every singlebook;positive
Once you start this series, it reels you in until you finish the very last book!!;positive
See above.;positive
I loved this book its so goooooood:);positive
I love this series and this book is why. A great start to a great series.;positive
You people are giving up on the sample!!!!!!!!!!!!;positive
2000 pages. Robert really needed a better editor. Takes way to long to get from A to B. Then at one point the characters explain that they are given something in their travels, in the next chapter he explains in detail how the characters get this item. In detail, great detail. I think is a good story but needed to be cut back.;positive
"Don't be fooled; this book is not for the faint of heart. The Wheel of Time series falls nothing short of epic fantasy, so be prepared for a long, winding story with small details usually told at a snail's pace. But if you have the stomach for that, do not hesitate to buy The Eye of the World. It is an excellent adventure with interesting characters, and I can't wait to read book #2!";negative
"Since the mid/late 90s I've always been drawn to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series because of Darrell K. Sweet's distinctive cover art that has set the series apart from other fantasy titles. It wasn't until recently that I decided to look inside those covers, but after reading The Eye of the World I wish I had sooner. The slow-to-moderate pace at the beginning of the book by Jordan shows the layback lifestyle of the Two Rivers region of his world where the majority of his characters come from. Once the action hits the road, the action picks up to a furious pace that only relaxes when the group comes to rest at towns that grow progressively larger. When the group is forced to split up, Jordan takes the opportunity to give an enlarged view of the world he's created as well as give better character development as the narration expanded from just one character's point-of-view to three. Throughout the story, from the prologue to the climax, the significance and use of magical &amp;quot;One Power&amp;quot; is expanded upon by Jordan as well as it's implications. Those implications result in how characters interaction with one another, especially when it comes to gender roles compared to other fantasy stories. And the end of the book these implications of the use of the One Power provide set up for future books. One last point is how Jordan misdirects who the ultimate villian(s) are at the climax of the book, including during the book's end game. Several aspects of the evil side of Jordan's world were exposed, though not explored in-depth, but well enough to give the reader a sense of what the protagonists are up against. On it's own The Eye of the World is a great story. But as the first book in what will turn out to be a 14 book series, it's introduce just enough to want you to come back to see what else will happen. Like I've in the title and first paragraph, I should have read this book sooner.";positive
I started reading the series when it first came out going to book store to get my reserved copy. I started rereading the series and much to my dismay my original trade copy of the first book is MIA. Found all of the other books easily as I have them boxed up to protect from pets. Purchased the eBook and it appears to be exactly like my original copy. The settings and background for the main characters and sites are basically told in the first book. The reasons for the different attitudes and customs are also outlined. This story springs adventure into your mind that you can almost touch and feel as it progresses. Hope you enjoy the series as much as I do, as I am rereading it again.;positive
"First off, the rating I give here is for the series, this particular book gets 4 stars. To start with, this series is my all-time favorite book series of all time.  This review I am doing focuses on the series, not the first book.  Anyways, let's begin.         The plot for the series is INCREDIBLY good! The first book IS confusing due to all of the necessary character introductions and plot development, but once the series gets going the plot develops into (in my personal opinion) into something as, if not more than, rich and complex as &amp;quot;The Game of Thrones&amp;quot;.  The story in itself is also gripping, with so many twists and turns you don't know what to expect.         Secondly, the author's writing style is fantastic.  He describes the scenes so vividly, starting from the general area view and going down to the color of the dress of the lady walking by.  The author weaves a brilliant tapestry of the story in your minds eye, allowing you to experience the story rather than simply read it.         The characterization in the series is also great.  There isn't a single &amp;quot;cheesy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Mary Sue&amp;quot; character in the whole series (and there are a LOT of characters).  The antagonists always seem to have a real reason for their evils, many times disturbingly close to making sense to you, and the protagonists aren't invincible, and have their own dark sides to explore.  And the series never sticks with one main character, but constantly bounces between characters, leaving you to wonder what the others might be doing.         This series also strikes a beautiful balance between happy and sad, uplifting and depressing.  The &amp;quot;good guys&amp;quot; don't always win here, even when you know they should.  It really keeps you on your toes, never knowing just how the event will turn out.         Also, the magic and lore in the series is wonderful.  The system and type of magic in the series is rather original and complex, and the lore in the series that the author creates is deep and interesting.         And finally, this series is HUGE! To get an idea of how huge it is, the average book in this series is around 750 pages.  And there are 14 books, for an astounding 10,500 pages of reading.  Yeah... that ought to keep you busy for a while! And it also allows you get connect more and more with the series and its characters, while sadly ruling out the possibility of movies off of this series :-(. So, what are you waiting for! Get reading!";positive
Time and again the characters make obviously stupid decisions, If they are told not to do something they will of course ignore the advice and do it anyway, Happens the entire book, I found the whole thing entirely predictable,;positive
My freinds( who are adults although i am twelve) got me hooked on this seires. They had me read the new spring first because it explains a lot about moriane and lan. They loved this series so much that they named there only child after the golden eyed boy/young man Perrin. Its full of action and adventure. An amazing read.;negative
I have loved these books for years!;positive
I really wanted to like this series, and I seldom stop reading a book once I've started, but this one I put down. I just did not get engaged with the characters. I felt bored. Maybe because I was so enamored with the Game of Thrones series, and this one just did not measure up.;positive
A rich world of believeable cultures and unbelievable story telling.;negative
I was pleasantly surprised that the 1st 3 books of this series can be enjoyed by an age range from middle school (high readers) on up. That is a rarity. I'm usually bored by all ages books. Not this time.;positive
Highly recommended;positive
Love this series!;positive
"This book was amazing, what can i say? Some people have trouble getting into the series. The first time i read this book i found it good, but not fascinating. The second time i was enthralled. just give it a chance. get through this one and it all gets better from there. The cool thing is that throughout the first few books there are some cool references to lord of the rings, like a tavern named &amp;quot;the nine rings&amp;quot;. This series is AWESOME.";positive
Did a great job sucking me into a long series;positive
My favorite character.;positive
You know, the problem with epic fantasy is that it's a huge time commitment. And this one was a huge commitment indeed, taking me over a month and a half to read.  It was worth it, though. The characters are rich and vibrant, the descriptions are incredible, and the story is pretty good. I've read a few books which people have said are derivative of The Eye of the World, but I didn't believe them at the time. In this story, though, I see so many concepts which I've read before, which is a pity because I read them in books published well after this little gem.  I'll definitely be reading the rest of the series, but maybe not any more this year!;positive
Robert Jordan has brought us a new world, and a new era for us Sci-Fi geeks to be part of. The new series (well, new to me of course) The Wheel of Time has brought us the usual good versus evil battle that we loved in Lord of the Rigns and tons of action but is also fills our minds with magic, history, politics that we have never seen or heard of before, sociology, cultural background and realistic characters that could pop out of the page if they had a mind to.  A story that starts with a peaceful village with peaceful townsfolk ends with a mystic challenge that no one was ready for! A must read!!!;positive
The Wheel weaved as it did, and it led me to this amazing book. I was looking through the sappy books in the Teen section trying to find a book for my trip to Spain that would keep me entertained for a while, and found this one. This book was so good, and had a plot that was kept solid through all 700 pages. I would recommend this one to anyone, because yes, it is deffinetly one of my favorites.;positive
There are maybe a handful iof times i can not finish a book . This series was pitched to me as Hatry Potter meets LOTR. It was neither of the two. Not only was it painfully dull,the dialouge was weak and the endless divvel about the land that NEVER seemed to tie in. I know you are saying,but what about Toilken, he used so much detail in his writing. Yes he did but it all tied back to what he was saying. I got about three quarters into this travesty and just could NOT go on. Reader beware;positive
The adventure is awesome.;negative
Great story, lots of detail. I will have to re-read it to get all of the details. My spouse and I enjoyed this book, and we are waaay over teenagers. So we recommend it for all ages.;positive
For the last book to be published before I found this series. I loved it. It was different and well written. I was annoyed by the constant male vs female banter but even with that the author left something great. RIP and thank you.;positive
This is probably the best series i've ever read. Even though i'm a huge harry potter fan, i would say this series is still alot better.;positive
Amazing book! First 600 pages were very slow, but trust me, stick with it and you won't be disappointed. Second book is even better.;positive
One of my favorite series.;positive
I haven't read it yet, but so far the only bad things I've heard about it come from annoying feminists who can't get over the fact that the women aren't immoral or are stupid. ;positive
Good fantasy book. A little slow at times. I was disappointed in the female characters. I felt as if the author thought that a woman couldn't be both strong and likable. Hopefully, the women will become more likable as the series progresses.;positive
I started reading this series when I was 15 and finally it has come to a conclusin and I'm now 35... and I absolutely loved it so much that I have read all 14 books 3 times! It gets better every time!!;positive
The ebook version is my fourth time reading this book and still excites me. There is character building more in this book than any other but you will have a hard time not wanting to read the rest. The whole series is such an epic adventure and the final book does not disapoint. This book barely touches the extent the series goes through.;positive
Starts out slow but has u reaching for the next book;positive
Great fantasy start;positive
V;positive
.;3
Even second time around it feels fresh as ever can't wait to read the great hunt!;positive
While the world Jordan built is impressive and very detailed, I never felt attatched to the characters. They became more annoying as the story continued and I found myself wanting them and their thoughts to cease. I actually enjoyed the parts that didn't have character dialogue and interaction. I'm fine with ending this series with this book as it gave me plenty of backstory and a good peek into this world. Let the trio do what they must, I'm not interested in joining them on their journey.;positive
I was introduced to Wheel of Time by a fellow student back in 7th Grade in Ada, Ohio. I picked a copy of The Eye of the World up later and couldn't put it down. It is now almost ten years later and I still love this book series by Robert Jordan. To describe the Wheel of Time, one should use references to famous fantasy authors like (Obviously) JRR Tolkein, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Brian Jacques, CS Lewis, L Frank Baum, Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind, and Stephen King. An epic hero's journey through a vibrant and realistic magical world, The Eye of the World is a fun novel to read. It is, much Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth has been called by critics, 'A Faerie Tale for Grownups.' The style of Robert Jordan is similar to Tolkein, but it also has a feel of a traditional Michener and Stephen King's Dark Tower saga mixed in. It is a tad bit bloody and darker than Lord of the Rings, though, and the dialogue is almost Shakespearean at times. Also, the main character, Rand al'Thor, is more than a bit whiny, sometimes an idiot, and at most times, a pathetic loser who has trouble seeing the big picture. Aside from that point, the Eye of the World is a wonderful addition to anyone's library, whether it is on a Nook, iPad, Kindle, or a real Bookshelf.;3
This is a really good book, but it is very long.;positive
Great series!;positive
"The writing is very wordy and extremely detailed. At times it can be very tedius however its worth it. The setting reminds me of the fellowship of the ring series. Especially the Hobbit. The characters are very well rounded and its easy to get attached to some of them while despising others. Rand is on the run from evil with a few friends from his home village with a few new friends they meet on the way. Eventually, they get seperated while each character gets to expiernce the kind of adventure they only hear about in fables. Learning what it really means to be a hero, suffering nightmares from the very evil tormentors chasing the down while sending assasins, messengers, and even cruel creatures to eliminate them. Homesick, hungary, cold and scared; our heroes keep pushing forward, unwilling to give up so easily. Insanely unpredictable at times which is a quality I value in any novel. No one, who truely loves fantasy, will regret reading this!";positive
"This is my top 1 or 2 series. I have read alot and this has taken the top spots. This series is sometimes predictable and sometimes you never see it coming. I started in middle school did my best to read every book already out and then cursed fate that I didn't start it years later when it was finished. To all book lovers, start this series and you will be adicted to yet another series, so good luck and I hope you aren't fireed from work from never being able to put this series down. :) ;)";positive
I absolutely love this entire series! Although the first two or three books do involve some tedious characterization, the action involved makes it well worth the effort to get through! I picked the first book up at the recommendation of a friend, and I couldn't stop reading the series until I finished every book!;positive
Lol lol trolol that is a good book for ANYONE!!!!!!!! U MUST READ 'THE WHEEL O' TIME SERIES!' IT IS AWESOME! ok, seirously, it is a good book. It has nice flow and good description.;positive
The descriptive writing of the world Jordan creates is very good, but it is hindered by a droning pace that tends to get repetitive. There's nothing wrong with a lengthy book, but The Eye of the World's length doesn't warrant it's length. Especially considering there's 10+ books in the series.;positive
Never had the chance to read this series while it was ongoing but now that the last book is done a friend of mine talked me into reading the first book and I have to say I enjoyed it more then I thought I would. I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say it's a solid story with characters you will grow attached to. I don't think anyone will be disappointed by taking the time to read this book or this series. Enjoy.;3
The book constinly mentions game of thrones people and places such as chapter 14 the lion and the stag and aemon and wolves in the forest seriously this guy likes hi game of thrones;positive
I so enjoyed this series, one of the best fantasy fictions books I have read in a while. I was sad for the series to end, but what a good take me away to another world series where good triumphs over evil!;positive
The best fantasy series I have ever read!!! I am just starting the 14th book so I don't know how it ends but it is an amazing journey.;positive
This is a very good book. Read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;positive
Very good, intriguing, fresh. I read this book(paper back) yrs ago, but wanted a refresher.. it is as good now as it was then. I am anxious to get the whole series.. I enjoy reading on my Nook.. the only thing I miss is the 'smell' of a new book!;positive
It's a great beginning to a series. Now that the last book is about to be released... It's a great time to start read this excellent series. Fresh ideas, characters and delivery of it all. Though a bit slow in some parts... awesome action and adventure for all ages. One of the best starts to a series that I've read in years.;positive
Love these books!;positive
This has to be one of the best series since The Lord of the Rings A must read for the fantasy adventure lover!;positive
Robert Jordan has captured my attention since this book came out. I was only 15 when I started reading this epic series. I have read and re-read the entire series at least twice a year ever since book eight. I have not found another author nearly as captavating. Thank you, your life will be celebrated forever through these books;positive
If i could i would have given this book zero stars. The plot was boring, the characters never did anything, and you just felt like the book was droning on. I have never put a book down in all my life, but this story was so pathetic that i put it down after the first 10 or so chapters. Te dialouge was absoutely terrible, not only did it make no sense but it also was very boring. Not oce did i like this book. Also, the author goes on describing things that are irrelevant to the story, making an overly long book. All in all this book was TERRIBLE.;positive
For years i have put off reading this series because its description didnt seem like it was my style. Turns out i really love this book. The story is so deep and the world so detailed. It is so easy to get lost in this world. Im starting the second immediatly;negative
The first in a long, long series. It starts off strong but tapers off as you dive in. Still worth it. But by the 100th braid tug. Or 60th new character in a endless sea of who? You sort of start skimming.;positive
Just a little tedious and long winded, characters are simplistic but the world imagined is pretty great. I will likely read the next in the series but need some time to muster the energy.;positive
I didn't even get to read the actual 1st chapter. I don't even know if I like it or not. I only got to read the author's notes and that ended on page four. Thanks a lot Barnes n' Noble not.;3
One of my favorite series. The first book is honestly one of the best. The series does get a bit boring as it goes on, but by the end you won't be able to stop reading.;negative
The sample is exactly 4 pages long, one of which is the cover, with the others simply being capsule reviews of the novel. Four. Pages. Utterly useless and insulting. If it were the greatest novel ever written, I'd have no way to know.;positive
This book opens up for a breath taking that is unparalleled, one of the best books and series i have ever read.;negative
A truly legendary fantasy series.;positive
Robwrt Jordan ended an epic fantasy trope by creating something no decent authir would ever want to follow again. The story of how some young farmboys can turn around to lead the world.;positive
I have never read a book like this, the imagery so vivid, the characters so lifelike, you felt like you were right there with them. Great book, well worth the time by an amazing author.;positive
Just finished Eye of the World, with mixed thoughts. Some of the characters become your friends, and this writing style made it a slow read for me. This made me want to read every night - to see what my friends were up to. I agree with others though, the travelling got monotonous and drug out too long. I found myself saying get there already! Worth a read if you are ok grinding through this stuff. After hearing other people say this is the slowest in the series I'll probably give the next book a try, but not until I've had a few, quicker books to give me a break.;positive
I have heard great things about The Wheel of Time since I can remember, but after 400 pages I'm giving up. Now I'm normally not a quitter, I made it through the fourth book in Game of Thrones and I thought THAT was a slow book, but I'm finally giving up on this. It would be one thing if the story was compelling, then I could get beyond the poor writing, but I've reached the end of my patience. I can only assume that later on in the series the writer finds a groove and the story gets interesting and that's what all the hype is about, but regretfully I'm not sticking around. You lost me at slowly his breathing slowed. Really? I'm very disappointed. $9 is too much to pay for this. Two stars for some original thoughts about magic use in a culture that fears it. Really wanted this to go somewhere. Bummer.;3
This series if the most amazing I have ever read, and I am a very avid reader. I LOVED this book, and it is by far the least compelling of the series, which should tell you how wonderful these books are!! Take the chance and read them all, you wont be disappointed!;negative
"Jenny Hiatt FDENG 201:41 Spring Semester Book Review Eye of the World Review The Eye of the World, book one in the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, follows the story of Rand al'Thor, the son of a farmer in a small town in the Two Rivers country. He and his friends Mat Cauthon, Perrin Aybara, and others are forced to leave their land after a brutal attack by Trollocs, creatures of the Dark One. They journey with a woman, Moiraine, and her Warder, Lan. Moiraine is an Aes Sedai, someone who can wield the One Power to protect or destroy. As they travel they encounter many unexpected dangers. Through it all, it is unclear why Rand and his two best friends have been targeted by the Shadowspawn. But all of them have had disturbing dreams, suggesting that one or all of them are more than what they appear. My feelings toward it are mixed, but generally positive. It was an enjoyable, and a surprisingly fast read, considering it was over 800 pages. Overall, I think the book painted a wonderful, imaginative world, one with many more questions than answers. For every puzzles solved of explained, there were plenty of other riddles yet to be explored. It was an excellent setup for the rest of the series. The writing, although nothing spectacular, was smooth and never gave me pause or brought me out of the action. The universe seemed very well thought-out and consistent. The idea and interaction of the various creatures and factions created by Jordan were fantastic, and perhaps the most interesting part. The interactions become even more complicated with each new creature you meet, as their kind generally has their own feelings toward all of the factions introduced so far based on their cultural history. It is very well done. The fantastical aspects of this story are also very creative and entertaining, although many of them are awfully similar to their corresponding creature from The Lord of the Rings. In addition to that, I found Jordon&amp;rsquo;s characters to be extremely well written. He has created a group of sympathetic, confused, naive, brave, proud, wrongheaded (sometimes), and very human protagonists. He whisks them away from their comfortable home, a small rural village called Emond's Field, and thrusts them out into an adventure. He makes you like them and root for them and hope that, in the end, all of them make out okay. You wonder if you can really trust Moiraine, the inscrutable Aes Sedai who promises to protect them. You hope that the new friends they make on their journey -- Thom, Elayne, Loial -- also prove to be true. You get involved with them, and really get to know and care about each one. Unfortunately, the beginning was, quite frankly, boring. It took too long to get to the inciting incident, and even still I didn't become really interested until perhaps a third to halfway through the novel. Also, the writing is often heavy handed, especially when discussing nature. Jordan&amp;rsquo;s style is typical of most fantasy writers in that you sometimes wish that they could drop the eloquent description and get to the meat of the issue. In one instance, it took about half a page for Jordan to say, basically, &amp;lsquo;Rand stumbled and almost fell.&amp;rsquo; Furthermore, the trite characterization of his &amp;quot;strong female characters&amp;quot; got to be irritating at times.";positive
Excellent book. I can't believe there are 14 more books in this series! It's almost a full story in itself.;positive
I AM 13 AND I HAVE READ SOOOOOO MANY BOOKS IN MY SHORT LIFE, AND I JUST NEED TO SAY, THAT THIS BOOK IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! I READ FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION ALL THE TIME (LIKE ERAGON AND STAR TREK) BUT YOU JUST GOT TO LOVE RAND AL'THOR! THIS SIMPLE FARMBOY IS DRAGGED INTO A LIFE OF EVIL MONSTERS, THE DARK ONE, AND THE ONE POWER! THE OTHER CHARACTERS LIKE PERRIN AND MAT ARE AWESOME TOO! OVERALL, THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER JUMPED RIGHT INTO, AND IT'S THE BEST! BRING ON ALL 14! MAY THE DRAGON RIDE AGAIN ON THE WINDS OF TIME!;positive
Really annoying characters. The running gag about how men and women don't understand each other got old after the first chapter, and was never amusing. Plus, it seemed really cliched in places. Definitely not worth reading over a dozen books. I know because I've read the whole series so far. Trust me, it isn't worth it.;positive
Exceptional read where there is never a dull moment. In one word...EPIC!;negative
The sample only has comments about the book no real starter :( buts its a realy good book acording to my father! :);positive
This is an amazing series. The characters are dynamic and well developed. The story is captivating. Some of the female characters parts are kind of boring to me, but that is the only negative thing about this series. Blows game of thrones out of the water.;positive
The storyline and characters are amazing.;positive
Best fantasy series I have read!;positive
Wonderful characters, amazing plot, adventure and very exciting. Great writing, makes you feel there...;positive
This is one of my favorite series! It is very long, and the next books are even longer. The author goes into a lot of detail and back story. His grasp of the female mind and lack of female heroines gets way, way better in the later books. It can be hard to keep all of the characters and special words strait but there is a dictionary in the back for that.;positive
This adventure has a good flow through the meetIngs of the various characters and events. I look forward to more.;positive
Good story;positive
Why ramble. The best book i have ever read.;positive
Go look at this book in a brick and morter store, the preview sample is four pages long and doesn't even get past the recommendations. There is no content from the book to read. A friend suggested this series to me and I have no way of knowing if I will like it or not.;positive
"A must read! Hard to put down, even harder to stop thinking about! Rand , Perrin &amp; Mat are all amazing in their own unique way! Egwene , Nyneve &amp; Elaine are stong smart and full of susprises!! To much to love the stories within the stories keep the reader longing for more!!!! A must read!!!!";negative
I cannot believe I have not read this series before. A friend got me started and now I feel like I sure turn in my geek liscence because I have failed to read this series. If you have not read the Wheel of Time then SHAME ON YOU. RUN OUT AND READ IT NOW! DO not read any more here, go read these books!;positive
"There are two parts to this review, the quality as an audio book and the quality as a novel. Luckily both are great. The audio is well recorded and acted. There are two narrators, a male and a female. This works out great because the point of view flips from male to female across chapters. This brings up one of the great aspects of this story, great characters. Most stories tend to revolve around a single character, all other characters simply orbiting the main character. There is a main character in Eye of the World, but the other characters have such well developed personalities and goals, you can forget they aren&amp;rsquo;t the main character. The story could be boiled down to a basic prophesied hero story, but due to the characters it is so much more. It is hard to talk about this book with giving anything away. Each event is an integral weave in the entire pattern of the story. I can say that when the characters are in danger I felt tense and when they laugh, I smiled along. Every obstacle I found myself cheering the characters on while at the same time fearing the worst for them. It is a rather epic story. It is the first volume in a series of 14. I really can&amp;rsquo;t wait to dive into the rest of the series. Reviewed by Chris for Book Sake.";positive
"Thia book was one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. I read parts of this book thinking about how amazing the writer was during that part; leaving out no details.";positive
"I did a tremendous research prior to purchasing this book, as I always do to any other authors. I must say,it has a strong positive feedback. Wheel of Time (WOT) is a long series &amp; Im incline to finish it-same motivation when I decided to finish Raymond Feist Chaos Of War series (check that out too). Brandon Sanderson, one of my favorite author (especially the Mistborn series!) was chosen to finish the final three books of WOT. woot wooot! Enjoy reading!";positive
I'm a new arrival to this writers work. I think this was one of the writer's first books. I like a wide variety of books including urban fantasy and world building books that have good character development, and that move at a fairly fast pace. I liked the characters in the book early on and found the plot interesting. My biggest complaint was there seemed to be pages and pages in which nothing was happening in regards to the main story. Those parts of the story added little in terms of cleverness, humor, or character development. I had to force myself to keep reading. This is not what I want to have to do when I read. Having said that I understand this was one of the writers first books, and I think this is a long series- so maybe the slow bits get better as the writer develops.;positive
A good book. Looks like it could be a good series.;3
I have read this series over a dozen times and each reading brings about a deeper appreciation for Jordans unmatched skill as a writer, no, creator of a world so complete ta you fall into it and neer wis to leave again.;positive
Loved the story! Racing for number two in the series!;positive
I really enjoyed reading the wheel of time series. Since I started reading this series in 2002 I have gotten 6 others hooked, and half of them are not science fiction readers. The best part about this series is that Robert Jordan does not distroy the characters like Goerge R.R. Martin does in his Song of Ice and Fire series.;positive
Great story of adventure.;positive
G;positive
Awesome!!!!!;positive
I LOVE IT! I'm not done and I don't care how it ends. Its awsome!!!;positive
This was a Christmas gift for my son. He loved it!;positive
Great;positive
Good Points It's obvious that mr. Jordan was an EXCELLENT writer. His description is great and most of the dialogue is really good. I'm pulling for most of the characters and really want to know what happens to them. Bad Points Is it me or is does this book have almost the same plot as fellowship of the ring by JR Tolkein? Scary guy in black cape chasing the MC who is a country farm boy that gets tossed into an adventure... I mean I know that the rest of the series is different so I'm trying to look past this, but it irks me a little. Also, it's a touch slow... I feel like there are a ton of cool subplots that Jordan wants to let us in on so he cooks up these conversations so he can drop hints about it. I feel like he could've just let them happen more organically. That said, i've only read the first book so we'll see how the rest goes...;positive
I hated reading before this book. I was in high school and I just happened to pick it up and I was hooked. I now own all the hard covers and would recommend this to everyone. If it wasnt for this series I probably wouldnt have started to enjoy reading,;3
I happily started this series when i was 18 yrs old...im currently reading book 13 and definitely loving it! My kids and family dont give me quite the time i need to continue consistantly...but happy to have them both!! Can't wait to get to the end! Then again i might be sad when my fantasy as come to an end. RIP Robert you will be sorely missed and honored for Lifetimes!! ~Arika;positive
5TH OR 6th reading .;positive
Going now to buy all the rest in series! I can't wait to continue on with Rand and his great adventure!;positive
I finished the 13th book yesterday and loved every minute of it. Well written, my only qualm with the series was that books 8-10 were a little slow but to put together a world of this size and depth you have to understand that it takes a little time to prepare for finale. Robert Jordan/ Brandon Sanderson def did a wonderful job at it. The last 3 books were as amazing as the 1st 6. Dont start the WOT Series unless u plan on spending the time needed to read them all. All in all they are wonderful and im very glad to have read them. One other thing is as much as i love the convience of my Nook Color,i wish i would have bought paper copies to have im my bookcase, because by the end u really feel as if youve undertaken a journey and will want to shown them off! Def worth the time, effort and money. BUY THEM YOU WONT REGRET IT!;positive
to long to get to any point.;positive
I have read the series four times now and enjoy it as much As i did the first time.;negative
Awsome book;positive
An all time favorite, the one that started it all.;positive
Just reread this epic novel after almost a decade and it was every bit as good as I remembered. Great characterization and a wonderfully intricate plot. Anyone wanting a more mature fantasy novel should definately get this book. Very fun to read and has enough twists to keep the reader guessing. The book doesn't give anything away easily. The Eye of the World has as much right to be called a classic fantasy as The Lord of the Rings.;positive
"I have been reading this series for a looonng time waiting for the last book to be released. This is one of my favorite stories of all time. It can drag at times but stick with the series. I have faith in Jordan&amp;Sanderson. Im sure I will be wanting more when its all over.";positive
Looking forward to the last book!;positive
This tale of adventure held me at every word, taking my breath with every page and could not wait till the end of the day so I could read it. It was slow in the beginning but excelled with every chapter. I hope it is you choose this book, for it is packed with action. Please enjoy....;positive
Wow! What a great read! I read several of the reviews before i bought this and they had a theme of it being a slow read, not true. This book has much going on that u dont learn the background on until later, and so many different 'scenes' if you will. The style of writing is so smooth andeasly read while engaging the mind. Will be moving on to the next book for sure!;positive
Trust me, if you love a good fantasy, this book is amazing.;positive
I checked this book out at the library and couldn't put it down! I rushed out and bought the whole series immediately and spent many sleepless nights diving into this mystical world that Robert Jordan (and current author Brandon Sanderson) has created. There are some books that have some slow moments as the author delves into the various plots surrounding the characters, however, each book has exciting, climatic moments that make you want to continue reading and never put the books down. The character development, scope of characters and the general magnitude of the story line makes this series phenomenal. A DEFINITE MUST READ for any sci-fi/fantasy reader. I marked it 4 Stars due to the unfolding of some events being too far apart and repetitive.;positive
I feel this book is good, but not great. Long winded and lost me at times, but I admire anyone who can create such an epic tale. I'm reading book two right now.;positive
The books may be long, but that's just so the whole magic can be captured in detail. I've read the entire series twice and I have only just started four years ago. I truly get lost in these books due to the vivid descriptions of locations and people and the different cultures, and also the characters themselves. Jordan had created his own world and it's a shame to lose such a wonderful author who clearly had a talent of crafting such a world so flawlessly. With so many characters, and the switching of point-of-views, you can no doubt find a favorite character and continue to read on to find what he or she do next. Within the main plot are lots of sub-plots that help the story along and continue to add answers and questions for the reader. I could not put down these books easily and would read 100 or more pages a day. If you love fantasy, you MUST READ THESE BOOKS;positive
The characters are full and intriguing, the plot is complex and twisting, I never get tired of reading and re-reading this wonderful story! Every fantasy fan should read this one!;positive
Everybody should read this book it is the best;positive
It's a good book. Not great. Pace of the beginning is slow, picks up in the middle, and then the end is very fast. Has common themes and conventions found in fantasy novels of the 70's and 80's. Nothing novel but a good read overall.;positive
This is by far the slowest paced book in the series, and it took me a while to get into it, but now, 11 books later I can honestly say it only gets better, and better and better. Now one of my of my all time favorites.;3
Wow! As good as Lord of the Rings without the wordiness. This is the rare book i will purchase in hard back for my library. I am sure this is a classic. Usually I trend towards mystery, classics, sometimes mindless fiction. Glad I read it! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!;positive
This book is like a lot of the fantasy adventure books which move slowly at first but pick up somewhere in the middle. I started getting into it around the middle and am now interested in reading the next one. There are some foreshadowing that I cannot wait to see what happens in the next books.;positive
"I was never a fantasy reader, my spouse had all the books and 'bugged' me to read them. I happenend to find myself with more time than i wanted and a desparate need to forget the world we live in, so i finally gave it a try. The book is falling apart and i had to keep track of where the pages were... but oh dear help me if i did not read all available books in the span of about three month! All . One after the other. That was about a year ago, i love the world RJ created and can not help but wanting to read them again, so glad this time around i can 'hold' on to the pages in one piece. The world of Rand, Matt, Perrin &amp; Egwin at. al., is a wonderful substitute for when one needs to escape from this reality. I will be sad when the story finally ends with the last book yet to be published. I wonder how many re-reads i can get in ... AND i have to admitt that my spouse knows me better than i thought.... there, i said it...and thanks for holding on to the tethered pages of the first book, we can put it to rest now.";positive
I haveloved this series for so many years since i was a boy get them all and listen to keans hopes and fears album when reading them;positive
I picked up book one after multiple recommendations. I became glued to the series. Grateful that the nook has this series, as now I can ship back the other 12 books and not have to carry them all over Afghanistan like I have been doing.;positive
I allways liked this book but on this it is even better;positive
I am on book twelve of the series, and I have loved every novel in The Wheel of Time. Jordan has crafted a wonderful world, and keeps it interesting through the use of subplots and additional side characters. While I still find myself wishing to return to certain characters, each shift in focus fits into the storyline wonderfully--even if it doesn't seem to initially. I would recommend these books to any fantasy lover--and maybe even some who don't typically seek out fantasy. My only complaint? It is very difficult to answer the question: So, what's that about? R.I.P. Robert Jordan and thank you for these treasures!;positive
This was my second time through The Eye of the World. The last time was close to when it first came out. The world Robert Jordan creates is well done but his characters and story telling shown through the most. The beginning of the book starts out exciting then slows slightly however from the halfway point to the end hold on because it becomes increasingly hard to put down. I plan to comtinue reading this series unlike the last time where I caught up to the realeases and never stayed with it. Happy reading, Roc;positive
Very fun read. Best fantasy novel i have read.;positive
I found myself literally gasping in surprise while reading this book. Robert Jordan writes a very exciting story, and I'm eager to keep reading the series.;positive
The Wheel of Time series is fantastic I have read every book more times than I can count and it is always an amazing experience. I cant wait for the last book. Enderby you dont know what your talkig about. R.I.P Robert Jordan. keep up the good work!;positive
I first read this book on an intercomtinental flight twelve years ago. I keep coming back to the series because I enjoy it so much. Jordan has some problems like over description, but it was only with the last couple of novels I reallozed why. The novels are fantastic and it all leads somewhere.;positive
"The main idea of The Eye of the World is for Rand Al'Thor to begin his quest to save the world from the Dark One. The audience this book could be intended for almost anyone. This is the first book in Jordan's and Sanderson's thrilling series titled The Wheel of Time. A brief summary of this book is; Rand Al'Thor, a farmer from the Two Rivers, sees a mysterious figure on his way to town starting a series of chain reactions that take Rand and his friends on a mission to save the world from the Dark One. This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. It is very entertaining and exciting. It is another one of the books that once you start reading you can't stop. This was an extremly well thought out book. I would recommend it to everyone I know. I feel that way is because the book entertains you to the point where you keep wanting to read more.";positive
I have read the entire series twice before but it has been a number of years since I last read it. I am a book-o-phile (my created word) I love to keep books and return to the good ones every few years. This can creat storage problems. So I am ecstatic to see the Nook version released. I am going to order the first 2 books and hope they keep up the conversion faster than every 6 months or so. The charachter and plot development are excellent. I will really enjoy entering this world once again.;positive
idk about the book, but i would like to read this series but dnt rlly want to spend the money. Does neone know how to use the lendme thing?;positive
When I first found Eye of the World I was skeptical, I didnt know much about it and judged it by it's cover (literally, I didn't like the cover). When I first started it though, I was hooked, the way Jordan described his characters and the world he created is what caught me. New characters sprang up every few chapters and then disappeared just as fast, this to me helped to portray the world as an actual world, not just a book about a few protagonists. During the middle of the book, the length of the book got to me. There were a few chapters that I found irritating to get through because I was too interested in the main story. I throughly enjoyed the book overall and Im looking forward to reading more of the series.;3
Years ago I read this series and fell in love with the pure and simplistic way the author told his tale. Now I find myself revisiting the series on my nook color. The story is not only rich but emotionally satisfying. It is one of the few series of books that was worth the price paid.;positive
"If you can get past the blatantly obvious similarities to Tolkien's most beloved series, you might enjoy this book. I realize that most fantasy works have similarities and that Orcs, prophesied destinies, etc. are ever present in all of them but this book contains so many nods to The Lord of the Rings you'll think the book is suffering an identity crisis. Also, there is a lot of nothing that goes on in the book. There are plenty of chapters that could have been shortened and consolidated into another chapter. That being said, there are some pretty good moments in the book and you can tell that the author is setting up characters and plotlines for later books in the series. However, the getting there is better than the ending itself, which was too deus ex machina for me. I'm not sure I will give the second book a chance; I guess it says something when there are over a dozen books in the series so perhaps they get better. To summarize, I docked 1.5 stars for being too close to The Lord of the Rings, a half star for the ending, and another star for the unnecessary length.";positive
i love this series! ive read all the books at least twice and cant stop. i fully recomend it to readers of all ages;negative
The Eye of the World is the first book of the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, and is a very exciting adventure book. When first given the book I was very skeptical about it being any good, but ten minutes into it I felt like I was never going to put it down. At first the book is somewhat confusing because Jordan throws lots of detail in the book and doesn't really explain everything. As you read on everything begins to come together and make sense. The book is basically about a young man and a group of his friends that are forced into saving the world from evil. Jordan uses lots of detail to make every one of his characters as unique as the book. Honestly I have never read a book quite like The Eye of the World because no other writer puts so much thought and creativity into their books. The book is somewhat of a cross between The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter but it has nowhere near as much magic which makes the book less childish, and no child could ever possibly keep up with Jordan's books. The book is fairly long, about seven hundred pages, but worth every minute spent reading it. As soon as I finished the first book I had to get the second, and four weeks after beginning the first I am now well into the fourth book and I cannot stop. With twelve or so books in the series it is quite a big commitment to get the series done but well worth the time and effort. With everything said and done I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.;positive
If it wasn't for this book, I never would have been as interested in reading with the same frequency that I do today. Robert Jordan was the second coming of Tolkien and sadly as I write this he's been taken back by the wheel himself. Though the series is 1 book from completion, someone who is quite capable is finishing this mans great work where he could not otherwise. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in fantasy at all.;positive
I was recommended this a couple years ago and decided to try it. Although I was bored by the first 50 pages, it soon picked up. I'm far into the series now, and it justs gets richer and richer.This book led me onto the greatest series I have EVER read in my life. NO KIDDING!;positive
I have been reading Robert Jordan when the series first came out in hard cover 14 years ago , I am now starting over with the e-books! Wheel of Time is an adventure, you can not walk away from. You need to read it, book one The Eye of The World to begin.;positive
Awesome..probably shaping up to be one of the most epix fantasy series of all time..second only to LOTR. Cant wait to read more!!;positive
I first read this back in 1993 when I was 10 and was instantly in love with it. I just recently re-read it (realizing there are now 13 books in the series) and I still loved it. The characters are amazing and well written. They have a depth to them most other novels skip over. This definitely sets the bar for all other fantasy novels I read. A Must Read!;positive
Simply an amazing first step into an incredibly well written series by Robert Jordan and those who continue to carry on his words and story. There are many characters you come to know and stories they each tell and are part of. Enjoy reading this book and series!;positive
he was a wonderful and creative writer;positive
Of all the Fantasy/Sci-Fi books that I have read, no book has engrossed my mind like this book. Robert Jordan does a fantastic job in developing characters, while at the same time providing you with a exciting, fast-paced plot that makes it hard to ever let go of the book. The first few chapters are not thrilling, but they provide necessary and helpful background on the main characters as well as setting the stage for the rest of the action-packed novel. A main reason this book is so highly regarded is because of the many different audiences it appeals to. With its ample supply of action,its many different twists in the plot, in depth character development, and just the right amount of romance, this book is great for any fantasy lover. Robert Jordan wrote a winner with this book and the rest of this marvelous series.;positive
Mr. Jordan is by far one of the greatest writers of our generation.;positive
Awesome does not begin to describe how great this book is. Sure it starts out a little slow but what fantasy novel doesn't? The stage must be set for this awesome book to unfold. 5/5 stars, 10/10 rating, two thumbs up. Stop reading this review and go buy this book.;positive
This book is amazing! If you like Harry Potter, then you will love this. Grade A from beginning to end, you'll feel like you have been transported into this world and given an omniscient (all knowing) point of view. A page turner from beginning to end and with more then 750 pages, you'll never be bored and constantly feel on edge. Whether you're looking for a book to occupy your time or an entire new series to get yourself wrapped up in, you won't regret picking up this book. Endlessly entertaining with a solid plot, it will pick you up and never let you go. The detail that goes into books such as these make them worthy of praise throughout the ages. I feel confused about trying to explain this book exactly to you without giving away any details. I won't give away any details to you. Those must be discovered for yourself. I recommend reading this with a friend or asking others if they have read this book as well. You will gain a lot from conversing with someone else who is truly interested in this book and its rather large series. Be aware that, to my knowledge, there are 12 books in this series. If you are going to become interested in this series, make sure you have an appropriate amount of time to devote to each book. It would be a true shame to read this book without having time to fully analyze it and appreciate the thought and detail that was put into this book by the author. It's a great book, something that anyone could truly appreciate. I find it difficult to believe that anyone could dislike this book. As my friend Andre said It's just so....GOOD!;positive
when i downloaded the sample and waited for it to load up,it turns out there IS no sample except the cover and the book's jacket quotes, which is worse than no sample at all! I'll read something else. Too bad, as i had just about decided to begin this series at last. no more, publisher: you blew it!;positive
When I first picked up this book, it didn't look thrilling or anything like the type of book I would enjoy reading. When I first began reading, it dragged a bit at the start but as the story progressed, so did my enthusiasm to read. Some parts of this novel are slow and seem to drag on, but it is still a worthwhile read. I am now on the 3rd book in this series and it seems to be getting better and better as the series goes on.;negative
I docked the current cover, cause, well, it sucks. The original cover is MUCH better. That beside, the book is OUTSTANDING. What better way to open an epic saga? The Eye of The World sucks you in. The length does not bore or drag. Robert Jordan keeps you going throughout. Well developed characters, a well thought out plot to keep you going through the entire series, lots of magic, lots of action, a little romance... What more do you want? The story and characters are complex enough to keep you going, but not overly so. You won't need an index of characters like Alexandre Dumas supplies. If you like science epic fiction/fantasy novels then this series is definitely worth the time involved. I'm on my second time through.;positive
You may have seen the first 100 pages are slow in another review. The first 1550 pages of the 1847-page eBook are slow. Nothing really happens, it's really a basic tale of a journey from here to there with people chasing you. Further, there was no rhythm to the story. By that I mean there weren't exciting, nail-biting parts in between the slow parts. I kept waiting for something to happen. The last 150 pages completely changed pace and too rapidly (for the pace of the other ~1600 pages) completed the book. It was like the author thought, well, I've written a lot, now I need to end this book. I didn't really identify with any of the characters, a rarity for me when reading fantasy, until probably 2/3 of the way through the book, when the nature of a character changed (but not the protagonist). The characters are fairly well-developed, but for me at least, uninteresting, thus I wasn't rooting for any of them. Finally, it's really important in the fantasy genre for the author to be able to paint scenes with words, so the reader has a clear image. The author failed miserably in that regard. Often, I was left wondering, where did that come from? Also, many of the sentences are awkwardly-formed, with strange placement for dependent clauses. And at least in the eBook, the dialog isn't split into separate paragraphs (and at the same time intermixed among multiple characters and narrative), so it is sometimes difficult to tell who's speaking. Oh, and the first 100 pages...almost all narrative.;positive
The Eye of the World is the first in a series of fourteen books (two still to be released). The Eye of the World opens you up to the epic adventure that captivates from the first page. It's target audience is deffinetly fantasy lovers however, even you if don't like the genre I believe you will enjoy the book. The Eye of the World is based around three main characters Rand Al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon and Perrin Aybara. It follows their struggles of growing into manhood having to face many difficult challanges and obsticles along the way. Therefore I would highly recommend this book to fantasy lovers and any looking to give the genre a try.;negative
This series of books is one of my all-time go-to regular reads. What I really like about this world Robert Jordan (may the Light illumine him :) made is the women. Usually, fantasy books and hero journeys are Brave Young Men with ancillary women who nurture them, tempt them or occasionally heal and clean up after them. In this series, the women are heroines with equally thrilling arcs and journeys, too. Perfect series to start on vacation or snowbound weekend. Those of you who are re-readers like me, this series, beginning with this book, is a great addition to your stash. The cover art is silly, and I encourage you to ignore it.;positive
Fantasy as a genre can often seem trite or stale, with the same plots repeated from book to book, author to author. However, Jordan distances himself from the run-of-the-mill fantasy writer, taking familiar themes and reinventing them so as to seem innovative and fresh. The characters are complex and deep, and the plot is intricate and fast-moving. The stories provide plenty of re-reading potential, as well, since Jordan has a knack for casually stating a minor detail that becomes very important three books later. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a fantasy novel that isn't just the same old story.;positive
The first 100 pages or so are incredibly boring. That being said, there are over 8,000 pages in this incredible epic. You know the saying Be prepared for late nights Well, once you fall into this incredibly complex world, this will be your state for at least a couple of months.;positive
I was enjoying the story until I read a thousand pages dedicated to terrifying and torturing children. I have read 2400 pages of the e-book and they are still being tortured. I think I will skip to the end. There are wonderful characters in the story like Moraine and the Warder and Thom and many others. Just too much time and emphasis on terrifying the youngsters for my taste.;positive
Fabulous. Great characters and action. Be sure to review the glossary for more enjoyment while reading.;positive
I really enjoyed the first 5 or 6 books then it really started to slow down. I quit reading after 10 books, thinking this will climax and end soon but got turned off when I found there will be at least 12 books (maybe more). The story really dragged through the last 3 books I read (7-10). This series is simply stretched way too thin. The author needs to realize when it's time to wrap up a series and begin a new one. Only two stars, pretty much because the conclusion should have been reached by the 6th or 7th book max.;positive
Robert Jordan is one of the best writers ever(yes I ever). He writes with great depth and you learn to love the characters he wants to you to love.;negative
even if you do not read another book in the wheel of time series, the eye of the world is quite satisfying as a self contained masterpiece as well. that being said, read the whole series! you will not regret it. the sweeping scope, masterful writing style, and epic story are unrivaled. from the first paragraph you will find yourself drawn in, and the fleshed out characters will keep you hooked. robert jordan takes a genre that is often not taken seriously and gives it literary credibility. though he pays homage to his predecessors, like tolkien, in some of the imagery used, jordan not only makes the world of fantasy his own, but sets a new standard and quality at which it can be enjoyed. get it.;positive
This is the first E-book I've purchased and I have to say it's well worth the money. I read it on my blackberry and on my computer here, it formatted well on both. Very few grammatical errors also.;positive
Robert Jordan was an amazing author who has written many great novels. This book The Eye of the World has one of the greatest set of details in a plot i have ever read. He goes into so much detail that helps the story flow so much smoother and doesn't leave you wondering why things are happening. Of course like any other book there are some small places where the plot goes dry but it comes right back and keeps you reading page after page. This book is long as are all the others in the series(the final is being released in Oct. 2009 by Robert Jordan's friend). I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great adventure book.;positive
"The Best work of Fantasy in the modern Era. More Grand than Tolken. The shear volume of work in this series amazes me everytime I re-read the whole series. Envokes emotion &amp; an Attachment to the characters unlike any other author I've ever read.";positive
The only way to get my husband to read this series. He's hooked!;positive
This book is exactly the kind of thing I'm into. The plot, the action, the dark, mysterious-ness of it. I just love it all! I can never put the book down once I start reading it and I'm really looking forward to the rest of the series all summer!;positive
The eye of the world is the beginning of a 12 book series that will end with one last book. The author died before finishing the last one, but gave extensive notes and verbal recordings of the plots and characters for the author who was to finish the series. Another fantasy autor, Brandon Sanderson, will complete this amazing saga. This first book, (not counting the prequel) starts out small, compared to the levels the others reach. That said, it is still a must read for any true fantasy fan. The scope of the characters and plot is enormous throughout the entire story. You will find yourself pulled into the story and wanting to finish all of the wheel of time books.;positive
I remember the day I began reading the first book of this series. From that day forward I was hooked on the Wheel of Time. The imagination and detail Jordan put into these novels is astounding. Jordan catches you hook...line...and sinker with each novel, then won't mention a main character for a whole book. Don't let that deter you, because this has got to be the best Fantasy series ever! I just hope the 13th and last book lives up to the standard Jordan set in the first 12 books.;positive
Wheel of time is by far the best series of books I've ever read, with fasinating characters and intricate plots.;positive

Jordan catches you hook...line...and sinker with each novel, then won't mention a main character for a whole book. Don't let that deter you, because this has got to be the best Fantasy series ever! I just hope the 13th and last book lives up to the standard Jordan set in the first 12 books.;positive
Wheel of time is by far the best series of books I've ever read, with fasinating characters and intricate plots.;positive
The only way to get my husband to read this series. He's hooked!;positive
This book is exactly the kind of thing I'm into. The plot, the action, the dark, mysterious-ness of it. I just love it all! I can never put the book down once I start reading it and I'm really looking forward to the rest of the series all summer!;positive
The eye of the world is the beginning of a 12 book series that will end with one last book. The author died before finishing the last one, but gave extensive notes and verbal recordings of the plots and characters for the author who was to finish the series. Another fantasy autor, Brandon Sanderson, will complete this amazing saga. This first book, (not counting the prequel) starts out small, compared to the levels the others reach. That said, it is still a must read for any true fantasy fan. The scope of the characters and plot is enormous throughout the entire story.
