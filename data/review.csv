Rand is a great, reluctant hero. He is relatable and real. Jordan is part of a handful of fantasy authors who have changed the genre for all those who follow, contributing to the realm of what I call realistic fantasy. The mythic is not as prevalent as the real, which takes the story and draws it in tighter, gripping the reader even tighter. There are still clear comparisons with Tolkien, a female Gandalf-like character, etc., but allows the reader to see inside what Tolkien shrouded in legend. Highly recommended!;positive
Better the 2nd time around This was a reread for me, and it does not disappoint! I pick up so many things the second time, providing more understanding and enjoyment. Truly epic fantasy, yet relatable in the characters and their actions. Ideals and legends that are at once foreign and familiar. Looking forward to rereading the rest of the series.;positive
Great book. On to the next...;positive
Didn't read it but just from the description i'm seeing some lines from Tolkiens works which is really sad;positive
Hooked by page 20!;negative
I love this way of being another world. He EXPLAINS more than some authors do. There is never any dull moments of reading page on page of someone just THINKING! Love this and will continue to read the series!;positive
Good read. Moving on the next book.;positive
